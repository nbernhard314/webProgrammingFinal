A repository for our Travel Experience Marketplace final project website.

To start this application:
navigate to the webProgrammingFinal directory in terminal.
Run the following command:
    npm install
then run:
    npm run seed
this will seed the database and create users and products.
Note if this is the first time the seed script is being ran it will generate a "ns not found" error.
This is expected as the databases are attempted to be cleared before they are set up.
There are two accounts available for testing purposes:
username:adam
password:password

username:rcipkins
password:pass1234

Feel free to create your own and test out the site!
